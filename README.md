# Human Scream Detection and Alert System 

A machine learning-based system designed to detect human screams in real-time or from audio files, enabling rapid alert generation and assisting in crime prevention or emergency response scenarios.

##  Overview

This project utilizes MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features and a trained Neural Network to classify audio as either **Scream** or **Non-Scream**. It includes a real-time scream monitoring system as well as file-based analysis, with visual risk level outputs via a Python GUI built using **Kivy**.

##  Features

-  **Real-Time Scream Detection** using microphone input.
-  **Audio File Detection** for pre-recorded samples.
-  **Risk Level Indication** based on model confidence.
-  **Neural Network Classifier** trained on MFCC features.
-  **Accuracy Report** of model predictions.
-  **User Interface** for easy interaction using Kivy.
